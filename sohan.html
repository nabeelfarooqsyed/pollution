        <h2>What is Carbon Sequestration?</h2>
        <p>Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the atmosphere to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the air. This process helps mitigate the impact of climate change by preventing CO₂ from contributing to global warming. Carbon can be sequestered in various forms, including in forests, soil, and through technological methods.</p>

        <h2>Types of Carbon Sequestration</h2>
            <p>There are three main types of carbon sequestration: natural, biological, and geological.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Biological Sequestration:</strong> This occurs when plants and trees absorb CO₂ during photosynthesis and store it in their biomass. Forests, grasslands, and oceans are vital for this process.</li>
                <li><strong>Geological Sequestration:</strong> This involves capturing CO₂ and storing it deep underground in rock formations. This method is usually associated with industrial carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Ocean Sequestration:</strong> The oceans play a crucial role in carbon sequestration by absorbing large amounts of CO₂. Phytoplankton, marine plants, and algae contribute to this process.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Role of Carbon Sequestration in Combating Climate Change</h2>
            <p>Carbon sequestration is a critical strategy in the global effort to combat climate change. It helps reduce atmospheric CO₂ concentrations and complements other methods like reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy, and promoting sustainable land use practices. While carbon sequestration alone cannot solve climate change, it is an important tool in achieving net-zero emissions and stabilizing global temperatures.</p>
            <p>Many countries and organizations are investing in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to scale up sequestration efforts, and initiatives like reforestation and afforestation are being implemented worldwide.</p>
